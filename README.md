# Ensolvers ToDo App


### Technologies used:

- Java 11
- PostgreSQL 14.1
- NodeJS 17.0.1
- React 17.0.2
- Spring Boot 2.6.3


### How to run it?

To run the application, you must first run on the console ```run.sh ```

This will (hopefully) run maven and install all the required dependencies for Spring backend (**_honshu_**) and run it, and install all the required dependencies for the React front end (**_shikoku_**)

Then, if everything went okay:
- The frontend app will be running on your localhost port: **3000**
- The backend app will be running on your localhost port: **5000**
